# Tree Care App 🌳

AI-powered mobile app for training young trees into perfect canopy shapes with photo analysis, personalized pruning guidance, and smart scheduling.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform tree care from guesswork into guided expertise by providing homeowners with:
- **Photo-based AI analysis** of tree structure and health
- **Shape goal selection** with visual progress tracking
- **Personalized pruning schedules** based on species, climate, and goals
- **Visual overlay guidance** showing exactly where to make cuts
- **Smart notifications** for optimal care timing
